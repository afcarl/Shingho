# Developer Guidelines

## Style
- All codes must adhere to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Variables names must be meaningful 
- Use snake_case. Not camelCase
  - e.g. **variable_name** instead of **variableName**
- Indents are to be 4 spaces long 

## Git Branching
- All new features are to be added on a branch based off of the **development** branch (not **master**)
- New branches will only be merged to development after passing all unit tests and integration tests
- The **development** branch will merged to **master** branch (gold standard) upon release of a new version
