# Developer Guidelines

## Style
- All codes must adhere to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Variables names must be meaningful and underscore delimiter separated. 
  - e.g. **variable_name** instead of **variableName**
- Indents are to be 4 spaces long 

## Git branching
- All new features are to be added on a branch based off of the Development branch (not master)
- New branches will only be merged to development after passing all unit tests and integration tests
- Proper coding practices are to be observed for merging
- Development branch will merged to master branch (gold standard) upon release of new version
